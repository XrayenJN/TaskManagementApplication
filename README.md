**Project Background and Aims**

The Task Management System is a fully featured assignment collaboration
platform for the Monash University student community. With the continuing rise
of group assessments, many students find it difficult to manage these,
particularly throughout the entire development process. The task management
system online platform will provide features for task collaboration, tracking,
scheduling, amongst other features, with the goal of keeping students focused on
developing well rounded skills in all areas.
